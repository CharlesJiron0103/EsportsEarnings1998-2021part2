Follow up: The Graph is helpful when it comes to comparing one item through a specific numeric period, especially if we want to figure out which year had less and which year had more. For example, the years that had the most total tournaments was between 2004-2005, while the least amount of total tournaments happened in 1998 and 2000s. To remember a Histogram is a visual representation of the distribution of a data set; Hence the visualizing of the graph.

Follow up: A Violin plot displays distributions of data similar to a box plot, except that a violin plot includes information on the relative number of data points with any given value. For example, in the plot above is the distributions of total tournaments within 1998-2005. The plot indicates that the median total tournaments was highest between 2004-2005, but the total tournaments in the 1998-2000 were more evenly divided than in the higher years.

Follow up: A box plot is a data visualization that uses box and several lines to depict data distribution of a data set. They are super helpful for depicting distributions of multiple things at once, depending on how you set up your data set. Nonetheless, with the plot above, it shows a distributions of game genres that are used most throughout the years of 1998-2005. Three genres stand out from the plot fighting Game, First-person shooting and Strategy. However, the genre that stretches out the most throughout many years is Fighting Games (1999-2004).
